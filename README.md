# Readme for Config Files
Here, I host my personalized dotfiles for Alacritty, neovim, and tmux. Also included are my zshell configs. To get setup, simply run the install script. 

Note, this will overwrite some stuff, so i recommed you read through the install script and edit it to best suit your needs.
